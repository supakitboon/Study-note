### What is BERT ? 
BERT, short for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, is a machine learning (ML) framework for natural language processing. In 2018, Google developed this algorithm to improve contextual understanding of unlabeled text across a broad range of tasks by learning to predict text that might come before and after (bi-directional) other text.
